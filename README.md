## Usage
The Makefile provides the following options for building and cleaning the project:
```bash
$ make          # Build the main part of the project
$ make bonus    # Build the bonus part (same as the main part)
$ make clean    # Remove object files
$ make fclean   # Remove object files and all executables
$ make re       # Perform 'fclean' and then rebuild the main part
```
### Running the server:
To start the server, execute:
```bash
$ ./bin/server
```
The server will output its process ID (PID) upon startup.
### Running the client:
To run the client and send a message to the server, use the following command:
```bash
$ ./bin/client <server_pid> <message>
```
   Where
   - `<server_pid>`: The PID of the server.
   - `<message>`: The message you want to send to the server.
### Example
In one terminal, start the server:
```bash
$ ./bin/server
server pid: 12345
```
In another terminal, run the client:
```
$ ./bin/client 12345 "Send this message to the server. ðŸš€"
```
